# sample_project
A sample project built with Django and Create React App

## Instructions
Clone this repository and implement these features:
- a `/users/add` api route in the **backend** to add a user to the database
- a form (containing an input field for "Name", an "Add" Button) on the **frontend** to add a user using the `/users/add` route

You are encouraged to read the django documentation [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/) and the react documentation [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html) to inform your implementation decisions. However, you are not required to implement a feature if you don't know how.

The features you do implement must use the [git feature branch model](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow). For more information on development workflow, visit our [docs](https://github.com/Digital-Health-Lab-UVic/digital-health-lab-docs/blob/master/sections/Development-Workflow.md).

## Submission

Once the features are implemented, push your cloned repository to **your github page** and email us the link to the github project. 
**PLEASE DO NOT FORK THIS REPOSITORY**

Please email the project to digitalhealth@uvic.ca with the subject 'Dev Sample Project - Your Name' or email us if you have any additional questions.
